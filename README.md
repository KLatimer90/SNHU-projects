Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

What did you do particularly well?

For the module 7 Assignment 3: Chada Tech Grocer, I feel the end product did what was specified in the assignment rubric. I feel I did well in the sense I met all of the requirements, such as displaying a menu window, taking information form a .txt file and outputting the information that displayed how many of each item was present in the .txt file for option 1, outputted how many of a specified item were present in the .txt file for option 2, and displayed a histogram for each item for option 3. and exited the program if the user inputted 4 for the option in the main menu. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

There are many things I can do to expand and keep improving upon the code that I created for this project. For example, I could ad different options in the main menu which could display other useful information for the end user. I could also create more functions in the .py code to create more useful outputs for the user.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of the project has to be a tie between the histogram output and the option 2 portion and formulating a way to make the user input not be case sensitive. both of these required loops and nested loops, which for my skill set, I found to be challenging. Once figure out though, everything seemed to work out smoothly. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project really helped me become more comfortable in a lot of aspects. For one, prior to this project, I had virtually 0 experience in writing a program that utilized more than 1 programming language, and I found it very interesting in how C++ could work with Python so seamlessly. Another aspect that I gained a lot more comfort in using was functions. I was hesitant to use functions prior to this class, but now I realize how much easier it is to write a function once, and be able to call that function numerous times instead of writing redundant code. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I utilized a few aspects in making my project more readable adaptable and maintainable. I made sure to name variables with clear titles, every function or process, I made sure to not it in the program and describe how it worked. I also utilized functions and described how they worked and what variables they would be utilizing.
